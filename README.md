# Calculator

For my training at the intership firm, I developed the following project. My task was to make a working calculator that should look like a given picture.


I proposed a JavaScript solution, with a simple structure: a HTML file, a JS file and a CSS file. I have followed the best coding practises, respected the naming conventions for needed global variables, developed separate functions for every arithmetic operation, and commentaries. 

## Functionalities
 - Arithmetic operations
 - Display of computations
 - Memorization of performed operations

## Further improvements
Although the calculator is very similar, a difference can be seen in the used fonts. To remediate, a tool should be used in order to find a similar font to the original one.
